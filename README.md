# Hash Cracking with Dictionary  

## Objective  
The **Hash Cracking with Dictionary** project was developed to test the security of hashed passwords by attempting to crack them using a dictionary attack. This tool helps users understand the importance of strong password hashing techniques and highlights the vulnerabilities of weak or commonly used passwords.  

## Skills Learned  
- Understanding of **hashing algorithms** (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256).  
- Using **Python's hashlib library** to generate and compare hashes.  
- Implementing **dictionary attacks** to crack hashed passwords.  
- Reading and processing **wordlists** efficiently.  
- Enhancing awareness of **password security best practices**.  

## Tools Used  
- **Python** – Core language for hash cracking.  
- **Hashlib Library** – Used for generating and verifying hashes.  
- **Wordlists** (e.g., `dictionary.txt`) – To attempt cracking known hashes.
